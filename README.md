Inverse Problem for the 1D magnetotelluric problem using SPGL1general. 

The work is a part of the CPSC 546: Computational Optimization course 
project. Following the implementation of the 1D MT forward problem 
described by Haber et al., 2000, we then apply the generalized SPGL1 to
solve the inverse problem.
